The shared database contains 3 folders:

  - Bioharness includes: 
     ## Annot_Bioharness.csv: the annotation of the route for each drive in terms of sample index.
     ## Bio_driveID.csv: 13 files containing the main data gathered using Zephyr Bioharness 3.0 for each driveID.
     ## Maindata.txt: the list of the main data included in each Bio_driveID.csv.
   
  - E4 includes: 
     ## Annot_E4_Left.csv: the annotation of the route for each drive in terms of sample index, for the left wrist.
     ## Annot_E4_Right.csv: the annotation of the route for each drive in terms of sample index, for the right wrist.
     ## 13 folders: containing the left and the right data recorded using the wristband Empatica E4 for each driveID. All the details related to the signals are listed in the file info.txt.
     
  - Subj_metric includes: 
     ## Annot_Subjective_metric.csv: the annotation of the route for each drive in terms of sample index, for the subjective stress metric.
     ## SM_driveID.csv: 13 files containing the proposed subjective stress metric, after validation for each driveID.
    

and 1 file: Records.txt lists the 13 driveID. A note is written when the driver performed more than one drive.
